      Abstract:
        This data set contains imagery from the National Agriculture
        Imagery Program (NAIP).  The NAIP program is administered by
        USDA FSA and has been established to support two main FSA
        strategic goals centered on agricultural production.
        These are, increase stewardship of America's natural resources
        while enhancing the environment, and to ensure commodities
        are procured and distributed effectively and efficiently to
        increase food security.  The NAIP program supports these goals by
        acquiring and providing ortho imagery that has been collected
        during the agricultural growing season in the U.S. The NAIP
        ortho imagery is tailored to meet FSA requirements and is a
        fundamental tool used to support FSA farm and conservation
        programs.  Ortho imagery provides an effective, intuitive
        means of communication about farm program administration
        between FSA and stakeholders.  
        New technology and innovation is identified by fostering and
        maintaining a relationship with vendors and government
        partners, and by keeping pace with the broader geospatial
        community.  As a result of these efforts the NAIP program
        provides three main products: DOQQ tiles,
        Compressed County Mosaics (CCM), and Seamline shape files
        The Contract specifications for NAIP imagery have changed
        over time reflecting agency requirements and improving
        technologies.  These changes include image resolution,
        horizontal accuracy, coverage area, and number of bands.
        In general, flying seasons are established by FSA and are
        targeted for peak crop growing conditions.  The NAIP
        acquisition cycle is based on a minimum 3 year refresh of base
        ortho imagery.  The tiling format of the NAIP imagery is based
        on a 3.75' x 3.75' quarter quadrangle with a 300 pixel buffer
        on all four sides.  NAIP quarter quads are formatted to the UTM
        coordinate system using the North American Datum of 1983.
        NAIP imagery may contain as much as 10% cloud cover per tile.
      Purpose:
        NAIP imagery is available for distribution within 60 days
        of the end of a flying season and is intended to provide current
        information of agricultural conditions in support of USDA farm
        programs. For USDA Farm Service Agency, the 1 meter and 1/2 meter
        GSD product provides an ortho image base for Common Land Unit
        boundaries and other data sets.  The 100, 50, and 30 centimeter NAIP
        imagery is generally acquired in projects covering full states in
        cooperation with state government and other federal agencies that
        use the imagery for a variety of purposes including land use
        planning and natural resource assessment.  The NAIP is also used 
        for disaster response.  While suitable for a variety of uses,
        prior to 2007 the 2 meter GSD NAIP imagery was primarily intended
        to assess "crop condition and compliance" to USDA farm program
        conditions. The 2 meter imagery was generally acquired only
        for agricultural areas within state projects.

          NAIP horizontal accuracy specifications have evolved over
          the life of the program.  From 2003 to 2004 the
          specifications were as follows: 1-meter GSD imagery was
          to match within 3-meters, and 2-meter GSD to match within 10
          meters of reference imagery.  For 2005 the 1-meter GSD
          specification was changed to 5 meters matching the reference
          imagery.  In 2006 a pilot project was performed using true
          ground specifications rather than reference imagery.  All
          states used the same specifications as 2005 except Utah,
          which required a match of +/- 6 meters to true ground.
          In 2007 all specifications were the same as 2006 except
          Arizona used true ground specifications and all other states
          used reference imagery.  In 2008 and subsequent years
          no 2-meter GSD imagery was acquired and all specifications
          were the same as 2007 except approximately half of the
          states acquired used true ground specifications and the
          other half used reference imagery.  The 2008 states that
          used absolute ground control where; Indiana, Minnesota,
          New Hampshire, North Carolina, Texas, Vermont, and Virginia.
          From 2009 to present all NAIP imagery acquisitions used
          the +/- 6 meters to ground specification.

           The imagery was collected using the following digital sensors: Leica ADS-100 (Serial Number
           10510), Leica ADS-100 (Serial Number 10515), Leica ADS-100 (Serial Number 10522), Leica
           ADS-100 (Serial Number 10530), Leica ADS-100 (Serial Number 10552), with Flight and Sensor
           Control Management System (FCMS) firmware: v4.54, Cameras are calibrated radiometrically
           and geometrically by the manufacturer and are all certified by the USGS. Collection was
           performed using a combination of the following twin-engine aircraft with turbines flying at
           16,457 ft above mean terrain. Plane types: C441, Tail numbers: N2NQ, N414EH, N440EH,
           N441EH, N441FS, With these flying heights, there is a 30% sidelap, giving the collected data
           nominal ground sampling distance of 0.40 meters at 16,457 feet. Based-upon the CCD Array
           configuration present in the ADS digital sensor, imagery for each flight line is 20,000-pixels in
           width. Red, Green, Blue, Near-Infrared and Panchromatic image bands were collected. The
           ADS 100 has the following band specifications: Red 619-651, Green 525-585, Blue 435-495,
           Near Infrared 808-882, all values are in nanometers. Collected data was downloaded to
           portable hard drives and shipped to the processing facility daily. Raw flight data was extracted
           from external data drives using XPro software. Airborne GPS / IMU data was post-processed
           using Inertial Explorer software and reviewed to ensure sufficient accuracy for project
           requirements. Using Xpro software, planar rectified images were generated from the
           collected data for use in image quality review. The planar rectified images were generated at
           native resolution using a two standard deviation histogram stretch. Factors considered during
           this review included but were not limited to the presence of smoke and/or cloud cover,
           contrails, light conditions, sun glint and any sensor or hardware-related issues that potentially
           could result in faulty data. When necessary, image strips identified as not meeting image
           quality specifications were re-flown to obtain suitable imagery. Aero triangulation blocks
           were defined primarily by order of acquisition and consisted of four to seventeen strips.
           Image tie points providing the observations for the least squares bundle adjustment were
           selected from the images using an auto correlation algorithm. Photogrammetric control
           points consisted of photo identifiable control points, collected using GPS field survey
           techniques. The control points were loaded into a softcopy workstation and measured in the
           acquired image strips. A least squares bundle adjustment of image pass points, control points
           and the ABGPS was performed to develop an aero triangulation solution for each block using
           XPro software. Upon final bundle adjustment, the triangulated strips were ortho-rectified to
           the digital elevation model (DEM). The most recent USGS 10-meter DEMs were used in the
           rectification process. Positional accuracy was reviewed in the rectified imagery by visually
           verifying the horizontal positioning of the known photo-identifiable survey locations using
           ArcGIS software. The red, green, blue, and infrared bands were combined to generate a final
           ortho-rectified image strip. The ADS sensor collects fourteen bit image data which requires
           radiometric adjustment for output in standard eight bit image channels. The ortho-rectified
           image strips were produced with the full 16 bit data range, allowing radiometric adjustment
           to the 8 bit range to be performed on a strip by strip basis during the final mosaicking steps.
           The 16 bit data range was adjusted for display in standard eight bit image channels by
           defining a piecewise histogram stretch using OrthoVista Radiometrix software. A constant
           stretch was defined for each image collection period, and then strip by strip adjustments
           were made as needed to account for changes in sun angle and azimuth during the collection
           period. Strip adjustments were also made to match the strips histograms as closely as
           possible to APFO specified histogram metrics and color balance requirements. Automated
           balancing algorithms were applied to account for bi-directional reflectance as a final step
           before the conversion to 8 bit data range. The imagery was mosaicked using manual seam
           line generation in OrthoVista
